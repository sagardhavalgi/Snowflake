# Snowflake
<h3>what is snowflake?</h3>

Snowflake is a cloud-based data warehousing platform designed for storing, processing, and analyzing large amounts of data. It is a fully managed service that eliminates the need for maintaining infrastructure, and provides on-demand scalability and performance. Snowflake uses a unique architecture called "Multi-cluster Shared Data Architecture" which separates compute resources from storage, allowing for independent scaling of compute and storage.
